## Project Goal
> The goal of this project is to offer analysis that can help reduce the churn of customers at Telco. 
This will be done by identifying some of the key drivers of churn, creating models to help predict vulnerable customers, and offering recommendations to avoid these possible churns.   

## Project Description
It is well established that the cost of acquiring a new customer far exceeds the cost of retaining a current one. With the need for phone and internet services in modern-day work and play this business reality becomes even more important to recognize for companies like Telco. A proper analysis of churn factors, and the subsequent solutions that arise, can greatly assist in keeping the company profitable as well as ensuring longevity and relevancy for years to come. Through identification of key factors in churn we can assist in predicting these vulnerabilities, address them with solutions, and help Telco retain market share of an essential industry while improving Customer Lifetime Values (CLV) and real-time margins. 

## How to Reproduce
To reproduce the outcomes in this project:
1. Have an env.py file with credentials (hostname, username, password) to access a SQL database that contains Telco data. Codeup's 'telco_churn' data was utilized
   for this project. 
2. Clone this repo and ensure you have all of the necessary modules and notebooks. Confirm that the .gitignore includes your env.py file to secure credentials.
3. Use of these libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.
4. Be able to run the 'Final Report' jupyter notebook file. 
   - Supplemental 'classification_workbook' may also be useful in identifying some of the steps taken prior to the cleaner final code

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.
