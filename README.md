## Project Goal
> The goal of this project is to offer analysis that can help reduce the churn of customers at Telco. 
This will be done by identifying some of the key drivers of churn, creating models to help predict vulnerable customers, and offering recommendations to avoid these possible churns.   

## Project Description
It is well established that the cost of acquiring a new customer far exceeds the cost of retaining a current one. With the need for phone and internet services in modern-day work and play this business reality becomes even more important to recognize for companies like Telco. A proper analysis of churn factors, and the subsequent solutions that arise, can greatly assist in keeping the company profitable as well as ensuring longevity and relevancy for years to come. Through identification of key factors in churn we can assist in predicting these vulnerabilities, address them with solutions, and help Telco retain market share of an essential industry while improving Customer Lifetime Values (CLV) and real-time margins. 

## How to Reproduce
To reproduce the outcomes in this project:
1. Have an env.py file with credentials (hostname, username, password) to access a SQL database that contains Telco data. Codeup's 'telco_churn' data was utilized
   for this project. 
2. Clone this repo and ensure you have all of the necessary models and notebooks. Confirm that the .gitignore includes your env.py file to secure credentials.
3. Use of these libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.
4. Be able to run the 'Final Report' jupyter notebook file. 
   - Supplemental 'classification_workbook' may also be useful in identifying some of the steps taken prior to the cleaner project code 

## Initial Questions


## Data Dictionary

## Project Plan

### Wrangling

#### Acquire

#### Preparation and Splitting

### Exploration

### Modeling

### Deliverables

#### Final Report

#### Modules

#### Predictions

## Summary and Recommendations



## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
